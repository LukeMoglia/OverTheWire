This one was similar to the last couple in a way. There was files in a folder which I had to cd into

These files were named -file00 -file01 etc

since the hint said the password was in one of these files that was human readable I used file ./-file00 to output the contents of the file

since there was 10 files I decided to loop the command. I could have done this one by one, but if there had been 100 or 1000 files it would
have taken alot longer. The script I wrote to do this is below

for fileNum in {1..9}
do 
	command file ./-file0$fileNum
done

This gave me an output of this:

./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data

once I saw that file07 had ASCII text which is human readable I used:

cat ./-file07 which produced the output below which is the password
