This one was a little harder, well at least to get an acceptable output

What I did first was file data.txt to see what the file was and it said it just contained data

I decided to cat the file and I got some non readable text mixed with some readable text

I used to strings command to remove that data so I did strings data.txt

which came back and I could see the password in the text

Job done right? nah not for me, as in a bigger file it could be 100s or 1000s of lines which have strings on

in the hint for this level it said it was preceded by some equals signs

so I used grep to remove any lines that didn't get a few equal signs 

the command I ran was strings data.txt | grep '==='

this gave me an output of:

========== the*2i"4
========== password
Z)========== is
&========== truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk

and the password is there
