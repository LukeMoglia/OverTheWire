ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
password: bandit0


This is what I needed to beat level0 

ssh is the command to shell onto the machine

bandit0 is the username

bandit.labs.overthewire.org is the location of the machine

-p 2220 using the -p tells it you want to select a port to connect to and then you put the port number. In this case it was 2220

bandit0 was also the password to connect to the machine
