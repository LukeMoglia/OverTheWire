This one also contained a file called data.txt

I did file data.txt and saw it contained text

then I did cat data.txt to see the text

it contained lots and lots of lines of what looked like passwords

On the hint on the website it says the password only appears once

so I used the uniq command along with sort to get the password

cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u

which gave the password
