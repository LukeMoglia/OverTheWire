This one was sort of similar to the last one. There was a password in a file hidden amongst a lot of other files. 
We were told that the file was Human-readable, 1033 bytes in size and not executable 
What I did was to search on size
so I ran command find . -size 1033c

This searched everywhere for a file that is 1033 bytes in size

This returned ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2

I navigated to the /inhere/maybehere07 directory and did ls

it didn't show a file called .file2

at this point I thought prehaps it's a hidden file so I ran ls -a

I then ran cat .file2 and it outputted this password below
