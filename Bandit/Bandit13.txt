This one was hard.

data.txt was a hex dump

this needed to be reversed so I did 
xxd -r data.txt

this left a compressed file

if you do file data.txt it said it was a gzip file

so I added the gz extension back on by doing mv data.txt data.gz

then gzip -d data.gz

and then did file data

that told me it was a compressed file again so i did this a few times until it left a human readable file which had the password

The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
