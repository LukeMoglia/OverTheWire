this one was sort of easy kind of hard

the file was there and I could open it and do cat data.txt which outputted:

Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh

on the hint it said that the position of the letters had been rotated 13 times

I found a command online which is translate or tr

for example this command could translate lowercase to uppercase

in this case I used it to translate each one to a letter 13 letters infront

tr '[a-z][A-Z]' '[n-za-m][N-ZA-M]'

so that command translates anything lowercase in the alphabet to a letter 13 letters infront

so for a that becomes n and so on and so forth

so I got the output of data.txt and ran that command on it

cat data.txt | tr '[a-z][A-Z]' '[n-za-m][N-ZA-M]'

which gave an output of

The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
