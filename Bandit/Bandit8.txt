This was a pretty easy one although first time I used the grep command

ssh'd onto the machine. did a ls to see what is in the directory

saw a file called data.txt

did a file data.txt and it was a word and then a "password"

the hint on the website had the password next to Millionth

so I used the grep command to return the line of text with millionth on it

grep -i 'millionth' data.txt

which returned

millionth	cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

and the password was correct


cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV
